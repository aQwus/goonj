> Your Cry For Help. Heard.


####  The Problem

During any rescue mission the biggest problem faced by any rescue team is to find the victims at the final stage. Sure, they know that this building is on fire, but do they know how many people are inside that particular building ? How do you ensure you have saved every last person ? How do you reach out to the victim and he/she to you vice versa ?

The problem arises when even in such a _connected_ world we are cut off from any form of help because our mobile phones or internet can't be used at such times of need and we can't let anyone know about our dire situation.

#### The Solution

Goonj is a breakthrough app which uses your phone's Wi-Fi and bluetooth capabilities to create a local peer-to-peer network through which you can share your location and/or your situation to people and the rescue teams nearby if needed.

Since this network does not require the need of your traditional mobile-networks and towers, any sort of calamity won't affect your ability to reach out and ask for help. Your cry for help will be heard.
